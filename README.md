Text Analysis for SOCI3501 - Machine Learning for Social Science

### quanteda:
These two resources includes the chapter *Text as Data* by Ken Benoit -- creator of the **quanteda** package -- from *The SAGE Handbook of Research Methods in Political Science and International Relations*. **quanteda** is a powerful package that also incorporates other important packages necessary for text analysis through dependencies, including the **tidytext** package (see below). The tutorials page is a very helpful resource to walk through all aspects of the package with code you can replicate for use in your own RStudio program.

### tidytext:

These next two books are companions, with a third introduction webpage for a quick start to the **tidytext** package. The first is more basic and introductory, good if you have no text analysis background. The second text is a natural segue from the first and is more technical and, obviously, focused on ML. Both focus on the **tidytext** and **tidyverse** approach.

* [*Supervised Machine Learning for Text Analysis in R* by Emil Hvitfeldt & Julia Silge](https://smltar.com) 
* [Introduction to tidytext](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidytext/vignettes/tidytext.html)

### Text as Data 
This next resource is very useful book that is not open access but worthwhile if text analysis is something you consider doing further. The second resource is a website made to accompany the text, which may prove useful even without the book.

* [*Text as Data: A New Framework for Machine Learning and the Social Sciences* by Justin Grimmer, Margaret E. Roberts & Brandon M. Stewart](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691207544/text-as-data)
* [*Text as Data R Code* by Joe Ornstein](https://joeornstein.github.io/text-as-data/)
